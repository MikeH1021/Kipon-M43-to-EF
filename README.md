Reupload of all Kipon M43 to EF firmware update files (since they're not hosted on their official site)

For me (i was on v2.6.0) I had to update from 2.6 to 2.8. then 2.9 then 2.9.4

Run them in that order, then if you have the 0.7x focal reducer model, you'll need to follow the below instructions to set the focal reduction.

Connect the adapter and computer with a USB cable, open file M43toEF_Expert_Tools.exe (password:67240872), Click “search” button, it will show Model, current version and Serial ID 

Choose “0.7×” below “Optic Reducer” and click “Write” button
 
Open file KiponM43toEF_V2_9_0_20170928.exe, it shows as follow
 
Click “Search” button,it will show Model, current version and Serial ID and then click “Update FW” to finish the update.

Idk how many people have these Kipon MFT speedboosters but I hope I helped someone out!
